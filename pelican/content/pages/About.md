Title: About

I have been working as an engineer in the solar industry since 2009 with a year long break to complete a Masterâ€™s in Architectural Sciences in 2010-11.

I am always looking for a better way to complete the task at hand. In recent years, this approach has led me to study and apply the Python open source data science tools to my day job as an engineer in the solar industry.
