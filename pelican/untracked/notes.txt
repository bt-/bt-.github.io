I was working on getting a blog setup using pelican
and the pelican-bootstrap3 theme.

I was able to use the pelicanconf.py to make the site and view it locally
with the theme correctly applied.

Using the publishconf.py to make the site and then push it to github did not
work.  Github pages did not render it correctly and sent an error.

"The page build failed for the `master` branch with the following error:

The tag `set` on line 19 in `pelican/pelican-themes/elegant/documentation/content/Extra` is not a recognized Liquid tag. For more information, see https://help.github.com/en/articles/page-build-failed-unknown-tag-error."

The primary difference between pelicanconf and publishconf is changing the
SITEURL AND RELATIVE_URLS settings.

For local development the SITEURL is blank and RELATIVE_URLS is true.
